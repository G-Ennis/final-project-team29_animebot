Description:
AnimeBot is a Java Bot that is integrated with the Jikan API which interfaces with MyAnimeList
to return details on any anime and manga on Slack. The connection between the running Java program and 
the Slack workspace is the Bot Token which was created.  AnimeBot uses the JBot framework and is able to
pick up on user questions and commands by using regex controllers.
